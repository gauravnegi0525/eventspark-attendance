## Connecting this project to Supabase (Auth + DB)

This project is pre-wired to work with Supabase. Follow these steps to connect and test authentication.

1. Create a Supabase project at https://app.supabase.com and copy the Project URL and anon (publishable) key.

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root (or update it) with these entries:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project-ref.supabase.co"
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your-anon-publishable-key"
```

3. (Optional) Run the SQL in `supabase/sql/init.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor to create example tables.

4. In the Supabase dashboard go to Authentication â†’ Settings and enable Email signups. Add OAuth providers if desired.

5. Start the dev server and test:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the app, click Login, and sign up / sign in to verify the flow.

If you need role-based access, create a `roles` table or add metadata to `auth.users` and enforce policies in Supabase or in the app's `RequireAuth` wrapper.
